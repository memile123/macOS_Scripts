# macOS_Scripts
Scripts for use on macOS

All scripts content has been researched and created to further my own knowledge and development. All have been tested on VM's running on my homelab server (edited to remove any username or password that are specific to my requirements). If there is a better way to do what I've tried to do then please contribute to my content.

Scripts found in the Work Scripts (JAMF) folder have been created alongside my companies Mac-Infrastructure team to further my development.
